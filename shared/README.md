# 🔗 Shared Code

This directory is reserved for code shared between browser extensions.

## Status

⏳ **Not yet populated**

## Planned Contents

When the Chrome extension is implemented, common code may include:
- Constants (API endpoints, storage keys)
- Utility functions (date formatting, touch comparison)
- Notification message formatting

## Notes

Due to differences between Firefox Manifest V2 and Chrome Manifest V3, significant portions of each extension will remain browser-specific. This directory will contain only truly portable logic.
